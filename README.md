# Signal-Processing-and-Alignment
Processing ECG signals and aligning multiple sensors according to a single reference sensor (work in progress)

This project is working with the raw data from "Simultaneous physiological measurements with five devices at different cognitive and physical loads" (available from https://physionet.org/content/simultaneous-measurements/1.0.2/) attempting to process, filter, and align the multiple ECG signals from various sensors for each subject to ultimately study respiration indirectly from ECG.
